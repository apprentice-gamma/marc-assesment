//The Library

//You've been contracted to write a piece of software for the local library. The software needs to meet the following requirements:

//- The software should track the library's inventory of books
//- Each book listing should include the title, author, genre (Fiction, Non-Fiction, etc.), length, and checked-in/checked-out status
//- Librarians should be able to:
//a.) add books to the inventory
//b.) remove books from the inventory 
//c.) view a list of all the books in the library
//d.) view a list of all the books in a given genre
//e.) search for a book by title or author

var sget = require('sget');

function userInput(str){
	return sget(str);
};

var Book = new Object();
	Book.title = title;
	Book.author = author;
	Book.genre = genre;
	Book.length = length;
	Book.checkedOut = checkedOut;
